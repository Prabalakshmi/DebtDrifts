# Background and Motivation

A Student loan is the money a student borrows from the federal government or private lender that would help them pay for their university. It is estimated that around 42.8 million people have
student debt, and the total would amount to 1.77 trillion dollars (in 2022 December). An average student borrows around 35000 Dollars to attain a bachelor’s degree. The benefits of student loans
are that they are easily accessible by students, and it can help them finance their college education without paying much interest. On the other hand, student loans can become financially crippling
as the borrower would have to typically make a payment of between 200$ and 300$ (the payment is higher if the loan is higher than the average amount!). As one can imagine, this would mean that
the borrower would have to put his other financial goals aside, such as buying a house, or saving for retirement. In order to make the lives of these borrowers easier, Joe Biden has announced
student loan forgiveness in which, the Biden administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loans for those making less than $125,000 a year for individuals or $250,000 for married
couples or heads of households and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients who meet the income threshold. <br>

Since this announcement has been made, there has been a huge controversy going on regarding this. People have conflicting ideas regarding this announcement. The Economists are concerned
about how the plan would affect the country’s economy. Moreover, students who have recently paid off their loans are also against this as they have no perk from this plan while the students who
are currently on debt and have taken loans for their education are welcoming the plan with open arms. On the other hand, the current students and students who have recently graduated that are in
huge amounts of student debts are optimistic about the announcements and fully support it. <br>

In the current study, we adopted a machine learning framework based on state-of-the-art transformer language models to capture individual opinions on student loan forgiveness, and
categorize these opinions into three groups: positive, Neutral, and negative. We use more than 20000 rigorously selected tweets distinct Twitter users ranging from August to December of 2022. <br>

We extract and infer individual-level features, i.e., age and gender to characterize the opinion groups. From this study, we intend to answer the following questions after obtaining the results:<br>
1) What is the public opinion on student loan forgiveness? And determing the percentage of people supporting it.<br>
2) Determine what age group is likely to support the plan, and what age group is inclined to have negative opinions.<br>
3) Determine the difference between opinions held by men and women and see if they are significantly different <br>
